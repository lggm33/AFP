Always verify the project structure before any suggestion or code change and referer to [CONTEXTO_PROYECTO.md](mdc:CONTEXTO_PROYECTO.md)
In any change, update this file. 
To start the app we always should use ./start.sh
When I ask anything, do not create the code inmediatamente in the chat, just give a logic example and wait if I want to implement something or not. 
All de comments and code must be in english
